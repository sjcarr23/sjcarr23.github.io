					<p>After moving to Bristol, I joined The Wedding Secret, an online directory for wedding based businesses (caterers, venues, bands), as a content marketer. I contributed written and visual content for the site and social platforms. Despite being a very small company, we ranked first in many key search terms on Google.</p>

					<p>This was achieved by a consistent and effective focus on SEO. Targeting the right keywords and also making sure we were maintaining high salience, using relevant and concise meta/alt tags, and setting up a network of backlinks with high value, relevant sites.</p>

					<p>During my time at The Wedding Secret I was also involved in major site review and update, to improve the UI of the site. This included adding an improved search function, and a simpler categorization process.</p>

					<p>I left the wedding secret to join DEVLND an Ecommerce business that operated three skincare and haircare sites (men’s, women’s, wholesale). As Content Marketing Executive I was responsible for curating each brands tone of voice, and all the written content to go with it. This includes content for the site, blogs, emails, and social channels. I’d also work closely with the Digital Marketing Manager to develop the marketing calendar and create and monitor SEM and social advertising.<p>

					<p>As much of the content I created was designed to help boast SEO, I also took it upon myself to introduce features to help the site that would also work to this end. This includes adding breadcrumbs, mark up data, and collaborating with external partners.</p>

					<p>Along with my day to day tasks I was also involved in larger projects such as loyalty memberships schemes (each site having one tailored to their audience) and a creating a social media influencer network, to help push the scope of our social sphere.</p>

					<p>In July of 2018, I moved to Bristol Sport and have been responsible for maintaining and growing the Ecommerce branch of its retail output. The responsibilities that come with this position range from developing content and marketing plans to increase traffic to the site, to creating an efficient and simple UX to maximize conversions from this traffic. </p>

					<p>I work closely with marketing and media departments to create campaigns that can pushed out to increase site exposure during key points in the season (derby games, transfer windows, playoff push). As sport is can often be full of unforeseen surprises, I’m also sure to create plan campaigns that can be pushed out at short notice, to make the most of these on pitch events.</p>

					<p>To improve user journeys, I’ve worked hard to increase the sites analytical features, making it easier to understand where the experience may be falling short. This entails adding Google containers and creating tags and triggers that measure things such as scroll depth, element visibility, 404 page occurrences, and “Rage” clicks.</p>

					<p>Where I’ve been using Google tag manager to understand user journeys, I’ve used google search console to understand user acquisition, better select keyword to target, and generally improve SEO.</p>

					<p>As well targetting more valuable keywords, ive also been able to identify key pages which would better benfit from mark up data to create richer snippets in search results.</p>

					<p>For social advertising, I’ve implemented the use of retail specific pixel to increase the effectiveness of dynamic ads and retargeting efforts through social media.</p>
