	<p class="intro">My names Sam and this is my lockdown project. Despite what you've most likely heard, Im not perfect and the same goes for my code. Appologies for any bumps you may hit, this project is still a bit of a work in progress.</p>
	<!--<p class="intro">Long gone are the days where I hand out my CV via archaic print outs, or email out poor resolution PDF's with reckless abandon. Now my CV can be everywhere you are, through the magic of the World Wide Web and your portable telephonic device.</p>
	<p class="intro">Marvel at my wide range of HTML elements. Look on in awe at the many CSS/SASS styling properties I've bended to my will. Bow down to might of my Javascript functions!</p>-->

					<p>After moving to Bristol, I joined The Wedding Secret, an online directory for wedding based businesses (caterers, venues, bands), as a content marketer. I contributed written and visual content for the site and social platforms. Despite being a very small company, we ranked first in many key search terms on Google.</p>

					<p>This was achieved by a consistent and effective focus on SEO. Targeting the right keywords and also making sure we were maintaining high salience, using relevant and concise meta/alt tags, and setting up a network of backlinks with high value, relevant sites.</p>

					<p>During my time at The Wedding Secret I was also involved in major site review and update, to improve the UI of the site. This included adding an improved search function, and a simpler categorization process.</p>

					<p>I left the wedding secret to join DEVLND an Ecommerce business that operated three skincare and haircare sites (men’s, women’s, wholesale). As Content Marketing Executive I was responsible for curating each brands tone of voice, and all the written content to go with it. This includes content for the site, blogs, emails, and social channels. I’d also work closely with the Digital Marketing Manager to develop the marketing calendar and create and monitor SEM and social advertising.<p>

					<p>As much of the content I created was designed to help boast SEO, I also took it upon myself to introduce features to help the site that would also work to this end. This includes adding breadcrumbs, mark up data, and collaborating with external partners.</p>

					<p>Along with my day to day tasks I was also involved in larger projects such as loyalty memberships schemes (each site having one tailored to their audience) and a creating a social media influencer network, to help push the scope of our social sphere.</p>

					<p>In July of 2018, I moved to Bristol Sport and have been responsible for maintaining and growing the Ecommerce for each of their teams (City, Bears, Flyers). My responsibilities include developing content and marketing plans to increase traffic to the site, to creating an efficient and simple UX to maximize conversions from this traffic.</p>
					<p>I develop campaigns to drive revenue during key points of the season (derby games, transfer windows, playoff push), as well as campaigns that can be pushed out in short notice, to make the most of big events that happen on the pitch. </p>
					<p>For these I’ll work closely with the design team to produce content including images, gifs, and video, and then the media team to push it out through the appropriate channels. I also work closely with the designers to create visual content for each teams site that fits each of their unique brands.</p>
					<p>I’ve increased the sites analytical features, to understand where the user experience may be falling short. This includes implementing Google Tag Manager to track events like rage clicks, and element visibility through each user journey. this data has helped my streamline the user journey, improving conversion rates.</p>
					<p>I’ve also used Search Console to better understand user acquisition, indicating which keywords to target and pages that benefit most from mark-up data, helping to boost search rankings.</p>
					<p>For social advertising, I’ve implemented the use of retail specific pixel to increase the effectiveness of dynamic ads and retargeting efforts through social media, ensuring we’re delivering the right content, to the right people.</p>
					<p>Ill also work with external partners and suppliers to ensure the offline elements of the ecommerce experience like delivery, are of a high standard.</p>
					<p>By the end of my first year in Bristol Sport, I succeeded in:
						<ul>
						  <li>Increasing Ecommerce percentage of total retail revenue from 22% to 30%</li>
						  <li>Increasing site traffic by 56%</li>
						  <li>Increasing Ecommerce revenue by 68%</li>
						  <li>More than doubling kit pre-orders</li>
						</ul>
