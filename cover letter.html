				<p>After moving to Bristol, I joined The Wedding Secret, an online directory for wedding based businesses (caterers, venues, bands), as a content marketer. I contributed written and visual content for the site and social platforms. Despite being a very small company, we ranked first in many key search terms on Google.</p>

				<p>This was achieved by a consistent and effective focus on SEO. Targeting the right keywords and also making sure we were maintaining high salience, using relevant and concise meta/alt tags, and setting up a network of backlinks with high value, relevant sites.</p>

				<p>During my time at The Wedding Secret I was also involved in major site review and update, to improve the UI of the site. This included adding an improved search function, and a simpler categorization process.</p>

				<p>I left The Wedding Secret to work for DEVLND, an Ecommerce business based in South Bristol. As Digital Marketing Executive, I was in charge of creating the content featured on the sites, emails, and social channels. I worked closely with the Digital Manager to develop the marketing calendar and create and monitor SEM and social advertising.</p>

				<p>I also worked heavily on keeping the site’s UX as seamless as possible, emphasising the mobile compatibility as the majority of our users were on mobile, as well as introducing SEO positive features like breadcrumbs.</p>

				<p>Along with my daily duties, I worked on large scale projects, including an exclusive membership scheme, and a social media influencer network.</p>

				<p>With Bristol Sport I have been responsible for maintaining and growing the Ecommerce branch of its retail output. The responsibilities that come with this position range from developing content and marketing plans to increase traffic to the site, to creating an efficient and simple UX to maximise conversions from this traffic.</p>

				<p>Over the past few months I have been increasing my activity with improving the set-up of the site’s analytical features to better understand how the site is used, identify what it does well, and where it falls short. This entails adding Google containers and creating tags and triggers that measure things such as scroll depth, element visibility, 404 page occurrences, and “Rage” clicks.</p>

				<p>As well as UX, I’ve been working to improve its SEO. Since joining I’ve improved meta data and keyword occurrence, as well as enabled Search Console and linked it to Analytics. To take things further, I am taking steps to improve markup data for search results to create richer snippets, in the hopes of improving click through rate from organic traffic and the sites SERP rankings.</p>
